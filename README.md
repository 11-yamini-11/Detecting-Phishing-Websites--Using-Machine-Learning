# Detecting-Phishing-Websites-Using-Machine-Learning
In order to detect and predict the phishing websites, we proposed an flexible system that is based on using Machine learning algorithms. We used the machine learning concepts and determined the models that provide better accuracy to detect malicious websites. 
We used a dataset from kaggle.com and performed phishing websites detection using Machine Learning algorithms. We performed Data pre-processing,checked out for any missed valuesin the data,trained and tested the data,performed feature scaling on it. We built an model by applying different machine learning classifiers and calculated accuracy of them. Among different machine learning classifiers we used,Random Forest gave us the highest accuracy. Next,we performed the application building using Flask framework and Python.
